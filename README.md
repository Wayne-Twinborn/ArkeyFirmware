This is meant to be a repo I can use to keep up the configs for the Arkey project.

To make things easier to deal with, each folder is a full copy itself. 

To build one, clone the repo, go into the folder for the controller you want to build for, then

- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..
- make

Just like you would for GP-2040-CE.
